You will throw into the street, the streets will be narrow.. Just like your body feels narrow to your heart.. Neither the blue of the sea, nor the bright sky will make you happy.

You will be too big to carry yourself, and on the one hand, you will be too small to disappear.. Someone will tell you something nonstop.. It's health that matters. It's good to be alive. Never mind everything will be forgotten. Y'all ain't hearing none of it..

Your tears will make you invisible.. You will hate her enough, and soon you will love her enough to die in her arms.. Y'all always wanna talk about her..

When they say, Death has been found or The doomsday will come tomorrow you raise your head and say What did you say? You shall not ask.. You will want to be alone.. As well as getting lost in the crowds... Neither one is enough. The past will make you reflect.. Almost minute by minute, but skipping the bad ones!

You're going to want to go through the places you've been through with her, to get to the places you're going.. This will not work out for you at all, but you will have to do it on purpose..

If someone tells you they can erase the pain inside you, you'll run away.. In fact, when you want to be free, you will resist to experience that pain.. You'll want to spend the rest of your life thinking about her...

All the songs will feel like they were written just for you. Your throat will be choked, you won't be able to listen.. Sleeping will be difficult, waking up will be easy, you will look forward to the morning...">

                    data-img="images/modal2.jpg" data-content="There are moments when you meet someone for the first time, you suddenly realize that you somehow know this person...in a way you cannot describe.

It's like this feeling you get everytime you look at her face and your feel this certainty in the form of tingles over your skin and in the back of your head there is this world of emotions which is building itself and it effects your thinking process and that's why you're unable to say anything meaningful in front of her because your brain is processing the meaning of her entire existence.

And then, she touches your arm like the priest from Fleabag for a micro second while explaining something random to you, but that simple meaningless touch becomes the foundation of your affection for her, as if you only wanted to live just to be touched by her accidentally.

You're walking next to her in her city, following her, showing her how you love dogs everytime you see one, worshipping her intangible gestures, recording her broken smiles, waiting for you to hold her hand while crossing the road, sneaking into her world of observations and listening to her speak maddening theories of modern philosophical discourses...

But no matter what you do, she is always with you, even in the moments when she is not.

You remember feeling her presence when she left. You remember seeing a dog right after she disappeared into thin air of forgetfulness and longing. You remember touching that dog in a way you wanted to touch her.

After she is gone, you understand that how much you love her. It's the kind of love where two people might not be in love with each other, but they understand each other so beautifully and so simply that talking to each other feels like breathing...

And when you connect with someone like that... in that moment, you cannot help but love that person and her entire personhood.

You look at her and you realize that... SHE IS THE MAIN CHARACTER of the film called your pathetic life.">
